Welcome to Netrino UI's documentation!
======================================

Release v\ |version|

Netrino is an open source Network Orchastration tool. It acts as the middleware between your network and BSS/OSS.

It has a RESTfull API through which you can program your network, as well as a WEB UI to start making use of it immediately, without any additional development.

Netrino is a module of the `Tachyonic Project <http://www.tachyonic.co.za/>`_ and its neutrino Framework, after which it is named.

These documents describe the UI portion. For the API portion refer to `<netrino-api.readthedocs.io>`_.
