Frequently asked Questions
==========================


**Q. I have no coding skills. Can I still use Netrino?**

*A. This is the reason why the Netrino UI exists - no coding is required. The only "coding" that might required
is to make use of variables in the templates. Jinja offers more flexibility though, so if you have a rudimentary
understanding of programming then you can get more creative with your templates.*

*Of course, if you have python knowledge, you may adapt the system to suit your needs. If you require something and don't
have python abilities, you are welcome to* `get in touch <http://tachyonic.co.za/contact>`_ *with the team
to request Professional Services.*

**Q. I want to deploy a Service that does not belong to a Customer, such as an Infrastructure service. Is this possible?**

*A. Of course. Although every service request requires a Tenant to be selected, one may simply create an Internal
(not billed) Tenant, and use this for infrastructure deployments.*
